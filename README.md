# ML-Project-Showcase (Coursework)

This repository highlights several machine learning projects completed as part of academic coursework. While the actual code is kept private to uphold academic integrity, this summary outlines the work, techniques, and takeaways from each assignment.

## Project 1: KNN, Decision Trees, and Priors
### Techniques Implemented:

- K-Nearest Neighbors classifier using:
-   Euclidean
-   Manhattan
- Cosine distances
- Information Gain & ID3 Decision Tree
- Prior probability classifier

### Key Concepts:
- Tradeoffs between different distance metrics
- Understanding how decision trees split data based on entropy
- Prior-based classification performance vs data-driven models
